MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is a practice that combines Machine Learning, DevOps, and Data Engineering to deploy and maintain ML systems at scale. It focuses on creating an automated pipeline for the entire ML lifecycle, from data preparation to deployment and continuous improvement. MLOps aims to bring agility, reliability, and scalability to ML, similar to how DevOps improved software development. Key aspects of MLOps include automation, version control, continuous integration and delivery, monitoring, and collaboration. By adopting MLOps, organizations can accelerate ML deployment, improve reliability, and unlock the full potential of artificial intelligence.
